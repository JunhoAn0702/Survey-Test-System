# Nuclear-Waste-Disposal-Robot: Nasty Scorpion
This project is to build and program a robot with lego. The robot's main task is to clean the nuclear waste.

## Task
* To clean the nuclear waste
* To differentiate regular waste from nuclear waste
* To carry the wastes to the right disposal area
* Avoid the fence and obstacles

## Getting Started

Please make sure that the robot is connected to your machine. You can compile and deploy the code through MINDSTORMS NXT 2.0 software.

### Prerequisites

Please make sure that the MINDSTORMS NXT 2.0 software is installed on your local machine. The software can be downloaded from here: https://www.lego.com/en-us/mindstorms/downloads/nxt-software-download
